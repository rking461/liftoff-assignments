## Submission Instructions

### Overview
A program to help with sports tornaments. My son does a lot of sports and extra caricular activites. It would be nice to have a program that woud organize his boat races and things. Right now we have a guy with a white board and things get confusing when there is a tie or when there is an odd number of kids. 

Each Troop or Team could log in add and store their players. It could build a tonament or season down to the championship match. Keep track of points for the season.
